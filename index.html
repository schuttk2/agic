                            <p class=site-history-paragraph>This gender imbalance carried over when those kids entered college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home. Male students then had a head start over to their their female counterparts because they had been exposed to computers before. The association of masculine personality characteristics with inherent programming ability increased, and the narrative shifted until programming was no longer primarily feminine work but masculine.</p>
